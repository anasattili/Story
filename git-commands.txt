git work by three stages
1- working directory whuch we make the files and git commands
2- staging area which it hte arrea after git add commands to save the
changes before we decide to commit
3- local directory or github (remoe directory) to save the changes after
the git commit -m "messages"

The git is used for the local repository
The github us used for the remote repository

git init
git add the name of directory
git add .
git commit =m "the message"
git status   the files which isa saved or not
git log     the message of each files of git add
git diff the name of the file if we want to see the mistake work
before we write git add to the file and then
git checkout the name of the wrong file to restore the last version
of the saved on working directory
git remote add origin the link of github repository
git push -u origin master
git rm --cached -r .  for remove all the saved files from stagging area
rm the file name    to remove the file
